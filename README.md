# JSON Web Token (JWT)
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The compact size makes the tokens easy to transfer through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. The information in a JWT is digitally signed using a secret or public/private key pair.

JWTs can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair.
